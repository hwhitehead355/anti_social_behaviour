# Trends in Anti-Social Behaviour Crime Statistics in England and Wales

This analysis was completed as my final project for the **Professional Certificate in Data Analysis** from **Imperial College Business School**.</br>

I use crime data published by the police combined with other datasets to identify trends around which areas of England & Wales have higher or lower levels of Anti-Social Behaviour.</br>

## Research Questions

+ How did the level of Anti-Social Behaviour vary throughout October 2023 to September 2024?
+ How much does the Anti-Social Behaviour level vary between Lower Super Output Areas?
+ Can we predict Anti-Social Behaviour using other factors?
